## Description
A timed coding quiz using JavaScript. 
Once the start button is clicked a timer will start and the first question will appear.
When an answer is clicked, it goes to the next question. When a question is answered wrong, time from the clock is taken away.
The game is over when the timer reaches 0 or all questions are answered. At the end you can save your initials and score.
